# GITHUB REPOSITORIES PORTFOLIO

## GitHub API was used to fetch repositories. 

In this portfolio, a user can fetch repositories, create a repository and also test the error boundary.

I made use of nested routes in the project and also applied lazy loading and suspense to improve the performance of the web app. 

My tough time during this project was going through the octokit documentation. I could have used other ways to fetch  data but I just wanted to use this Octokit maybe becaus I have a coconut head ðŸ˜‚. The process of trying to understand the documentation and implementing it delayed me but I was able to use it to an extent.

I really enjoyed working on this project and I hope to implement other features after the deadline of the project.

Currently, two official plugins are available are in this project:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
